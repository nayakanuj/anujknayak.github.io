A Short Bio: 
======
I am a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am currently interested in exploring the fundamental limits of fault tolerance in quantum computation and information storage in quantum systems.

Before joining the PhD program at UIUC, I worked as a Modem Systems Engineer at Qualcomm Technologies, San Diego on 5G technologies. I completed my Masters from the Department of Electrical Engineering at North Carolina State University (NCSU). While at NCSU I was advised by Dr. Huaiyu Dai for my MS thesis on "Information Spreading in Dynamic Networks." Before my graduate study at NCSU, I worked at Signalchip Innovations as an Algorithm Design Engineer on 3G and 4G technologies. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from PES Institute of Technology (now PES University) in India.

Research Interests:
======
Fault-tolerant Quantum Computing, Quantum Information Theory, Machine Learning, Wireless Communications, and Network Science.
